Just a simple tic tac toe board i can play with my kids.

quick and dirty version:
   always starts on x
   announces winner and clears board
   has a new game button to abort a game mid way and when ending in tie
	
to do:
   give choice for player 1 to be x or o
   allow for clearing one space
   build 1 player mode.
   clean up the horrible js code. yuck!
